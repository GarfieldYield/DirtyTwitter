Q: Why don't you use requests?
  
A: If there were more requirements for this project I would certainly use the amazing requests module. However, I do not want to require any dependencies if possible.

Q: Why don't you support python2?
  
A: Python2 is being deprecated in 2020. There's no reason (to me) for supporting a version that has a known deprecation date.
